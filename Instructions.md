# Simple-mongodb-sender-receiver-application
Simple mongodb sender-receiver application used as a gateway to send data between two remote PC's. It was used to transfer data remotely into HDFS on a remote PC through ssh.


Make sure pymongo is installed before running the files.

Use the following commands to install pymongo: pip install pymongo
                                               pip install pymongo[srv]
                                               
*NOTE do not forget to change my demo mongodb client api to your own. As this will deny you access.
